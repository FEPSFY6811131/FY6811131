            In this article, we will be discussing what Parkinson's disease is, how it affects humans (this will be the physical and mental symptoms), the problems caused by Parkinson's in human life, and any treatments. The treatments explored will cover levodopa, a drug treatment, and the CUE1, a neurotechnological device. Levodopa has been available on the market to be prescribed by doctors for a long time; the CUE1 device is a recent discovery that is being trialled by Cambridge University Hospital. The advantages and disadvantages of both treatments will inform us of the possible treatments available and the effectiveness of each. Emerging technology is revolutionising and can improve people's lives significantly however at what cost will these new treatments be available is what is not determined yet.
