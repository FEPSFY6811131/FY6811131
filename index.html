 In this article, we will be discussing what Parkinson's disease is, how it affects humans (this will be the physical and mental symptoms), the problems caused by Parkinson's in human life, and any treatments. 
 The treatments explored will cover levodopa, a drug treatment, and the CUE1, a neurotechnological device. Levodopa has been available on the market to be prescribed by doctors for a long time; the CUE1 device
 is a recent discovery that is being trialled by Cambridge University Hospital. The advantages and disadvantages of both treatments will inform us of the possible treatments available and the effectiveness of
 each. Emerging technology is revolutionising and can improve people's lives significantly however at what cost will these new treatments be available is what is not determined yet.

 Parkinsons disease is a neurological condition, and it causes problems in the brain overtime and gradually worsens (Parkinson’s UK, no date). Parkinsons disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells
 in part of the brain called substantia nigra. This part of the brain is responsible for making a chemical substance called dopamine. As Parkinson’s disease develops, dopamine produced in the brain is
 less and effects the movement of the body (NHS, no date).  Parkinsons can have a mental toll on people which can cause them anxiety and potentially cause depression, memory problems, and dementia 
 (Parkinson’s UK, n.d.). The most common physical effects of Parkinson disease is tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement (Parkinson’s UK, no date). Unfortunately, there are no permanent cures for
 Parkinson’s disease however treatment is available such as physiotherapy, medication, and surgery (NHS, no date). Over ten million people worldwide are living with Parkinsons and statistically men are 
 1.5 times more likely to have it than woman (Statistics, no date).
