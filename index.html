 In this article, we will be discussing what Parkinson's disease is, how it affects humans (this will be the physical and mental symptoms), the problems caused by Parkinson's in human life, and any treatments. 
 The treatments explored will cover levodopa, a drug treatment, and the CUE1, a neurotechnological device. Levodopa has been available on the market to be prescribed by doctors for a long time; the CUE1 device
 is a recent discovery that is being trialled by Cambridge University Hospital. The advantages and disadvantages of both treatments will inform us of the possible treatments available and the effectiveness of
 each. Emerging technology is revolutionising and can improve people's lives significantly however at what cost will these new treatments be available is what is not determined yet.

 Parkinsons disease is a neurological condition, and it causes problems in the brain overtime and gradually worsens (Parkinson’s UK, no date). Parkinsons disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells
 in part of the brain called substantia nigra. This part of the brain is responsible for making a chemical substance called dopamine. As Parkinson’s disease develops, dopamine produced in the brain is
 less and effects the movement of the body (NHS, no date).  Parkinsons can have a mental toll on people which can cause them anxiety and potentially cause depression, memory problems, and dementia 
 (Parkinson’s UK, n.d.). The most common physical effects of Parkinson disease is tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement (Parkinson’s UK, no date). Unfortunately, there are no permanent cures for
 Parkinson’s disease however treatment is available such as physiotherapy, medication, and surgery (NHS, no date). Over ten million people worldwide are living with Parkinsons and statistically men are 
 1.5 times more likely to have it than woman (Statistics, no date).

  Those with Parkinson’s Disease, cause their nerve cells to die which means they lose their ability to produce a vital chemical called dopamine (AANS, no date).  Dopamine is responsible for memory, movement,
  and mood and with the lack of dopamine, people develop mobility issues, mood swings and loss of memory ( professional, C.C. medical., no date).
  
The most effective treatment for Parkinson’s is levodopa. Levodopa is a drug that is taken and absorbed in the blood from the small intestines which travels through the blood to the brain where it is converted
into dopamine. The increase in dopamine concentration the brain increases the brain activity and generates electrical potential in the presynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitters fuse with the presynaptic membrane 
and are released into the synaptic cleft and fuses into the post-synaptic membrane. Increase in synaptic activity means that motor activity increases and elevates mood levels.
  
Recently, a new wearable technological device is being trialled in Addenbrooke’s to ease Parkinsons symptoms. This new device is called the CUE1 and was developed in Cambridge. This device is normally worn on the
sternum, and it carries specialised vibrations and pulses that helps improve motor skills, walking parameters, and reduces stiffness. The specialised vibrations are known as vibrotactile stimulation. This device 
helps to reduce hospital stay times and send impatient back home quickly (NHS, no date). 

Extra activity in beta frequency band across the motor cortex and subthalamic nucleus. The beta frequency normally decreases before and during voluntary movement and increases when still. The vibrotactile
stimulations can help control the cortical activity, decreasing the size of the beta activity. This function helps the body to move and reduce stiffness in the muscles.
  
According to an article from Cambridge University hospital, Dr Alistair Mackett claimed, ‘In the UK almost 1000 people already use the device, we are the first hospital in the world to use them with inpatients. 
The pilot will allow us to collect data and understand how best to use the CUE1 device in people with Parkinson’s who have been admitted to hospital.’  (Wearable tech device to ease Parkinson’s is trialled,
no date). 
  
Dr Jean Martin Charcot first suggested using vibrations to treat Parkinson disease in the 19th century.  localised stimulation put on a peripheral part of the body is far more effective and practical.
Charco neurotech found that the sternum was the most optimum position to place the CUE1 device for easy use and effectiveness. The benefit of this device is that its non-invasive. 
  
This device operates by high frequency vibration being detected by mechanoreceptors. Studies found that sensory neuronal signals are sent through 1 alpha nerve fibres to the brain (Charco Tech, 2022).
